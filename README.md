 # Case Study: DiviStock- Asset Tokenization Platform

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
    DiviStock,Inc.
* When was the company incorporated?
    2018
* Who are the founders of the company?
   Parker Bennett
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
  Trading cryptocurrency turned into a side gig but was initially a hobby for founder and owner of  DiviStock, Parker Bennett. Bennett has much knowledge about blockchain projects and became a big critic of the blockchain/crypto industry because he saw that there was no underlying value in crypto.  There was nothing backing it besides software. So this was the birth of the idea of DiviStock.  Bennett wanted to create a system where cryptocurrencies are backed by real world assets and can be traded on a blockchain platform. He later performed a research that revealed a concept called tokenization and saw a void in which very few projects are utilizing. 
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
   DiviStock has not gotten any funding yet. It is in its early stage of development.
  However, I find the many great features and options available on this platform to worthy of 
  Funding by VC or any crypto investors.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Asset tokenization on the blockchain is a process through which a blockchain token is issued to digitally represent any real tradable asset in a way that you can trade with a single fraction of the asset as well. A “token economy” offers the potential for a more efficient and fair financial world by greatly reducing the friction involved in the creation,buying,and selling of securities. DiviStock aims to  bridge the gap between non-crypto assets and blockchain technology and to alleviate the third party factor for trading assets back and forth.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of    this set of customers?
 The intended customer is anyone looking to invest easily and companies / organizations that are looking to leverage their assets with financial,business and software solutions.
 The global cryptocurrency market size stood at USD 754.0 million in 2019 and is projected to reach USD 1,758.0 million by 2027, exhibiting a CAGR of 11.2% during the forecast period.  A visual representation of this usage can be viewed in coinmap.org which reveals all the cryptocurrency merchants and ATMs of the world in one map.

What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) 
Companies such as financial institutions are experiencing a strong pressure on cost reduction and business optimization. DiviStock's aim is to build the ultimate platform for the tokenization of many kinds of assets, providing not only how, but why as well.  The tokenization process marks a promising solution in converting rights to an asset into a unique digital representation - a token.
The implementation plan may be viewed by some as the unfair advantage DiviStock utilizes against their competitors.  One of the main advantages DiviStock has over competitors (other than the tokenization platform) is the uniqueness of their features: Smart Loan Contracts, Legally Binding Smart Contracts, Smart Agreements, and Decentralized Business Incorporation / Management...just to name a few, are through uniquely developed smart contract technologies. DiviStock plans to use laws, agreements, and the blockchain technology to bind assets to a token by giving ownership or “safe keeper” of tokenized assets to the Divistock Holding Company.  This will be to start off the blockchain with tokens that are bounded and backed by assets to be traded.These assets will then be able to be traded on the Divistock exchange. The tokens that are bound by the assets will also have the ability to be                 converted back into a non-tokenized, normal asset either through the platform or through             individual development that would burn the token while preserving the asset and giving             ownership of it to the entity that possessed the token. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.) 
To develop digital  products (i.e.,smart contracts and Dapps) and manufacturing processes, DiviStock will leverage the EOS Blockchain platform for better efficiency, low latency, zero transaction fee and scalability. The EOS blockchain uses consensus over events instead of consensus over the state. It implies that the nodes validate events, not the state of blockchain to keep the blockchain up-to-date. Therefore, more transactions can be executed per second. Usability EOS provides a centralized file system to store files and server hosting for its token holders. It provides self-describing interfaces and special toolkits to developers. Flexibility When it comes to EOS Blockchain Development and maintenance, the EOS blockchain platform offers greater flexibility. Users can use the platform without paying fees to use dApps.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
The DiviStock company is within the Blockchain / Cryptocurrency domain

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
BaaS, Blockchain As A Service is a promising trend on the rise.  It is a new blockchain trend that is currently integrated with a number of startups as well as enterprises. BaaS is a cloud-based service that enables users to develop their own digital products by working with blockchain. Some of the companies developing a blockchain that provide BaaS service are Microsoft and Amazon, consequently shaping the future of blockchain applications.

Federated Blockchain is an upgraded form of the basic blockchain model where multiple authorities can control the pre-selected nodes of the blockchain. Now, this selected group of various nodes will validate the block so that the transactions can be processed further. It is predicted that there will be a rise in the usage of federated blockchain as it provides private blockchain networks, a more customizable outlook.

STABLECOINS will be more visible due to the high volatility of cryptocurrencies. Stablecoin came to the picture strongly with stable value associated with each coin. As of now, stablecoins are in their initial phase and it is predicted that 2020 will be the year when blockchain stablecoins will achieve their all-time high. One driving force for using stablecoin is the introduction of Facebook’s cryptocurrency “Libra” earlier this year.

INTEROPERABILITY AND BLOCKCHAIN NETWORKS is the ability to share data and other information across multiple blockchain systems as well as networks. This function makes it simple for the public to see and access the data across different blockchain networks. For example, you can send your data from one Ethereum blockchain to another specific blockchain network. Interoperability is a challenge but the benefits are vast
* What are the other major companies in this domain?

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
DiviStock is a very young startup with no clients nor commercialization and is currently in the developmental stage. The DiviStock Tokenization and Trading platform is expected to launch within months.Once launched, this blockchain technology will allow consumers and businesses to track transactions from start to finish without having to consult a central authority tasked with preserving the transaction or encrypting the data. By compartmentalising these transactions, it provides transparency of what’s going on in the history of transactions and also makes these transactions more secure.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
Auditability: mistakes eliminated. Blockchain offers a shared ledger of transactions with full traceability of any assets and associated activity, enabling organizations to "raise levels of confidence in the data they are producing without having to manually validate the data." 

Compliance: risk mitigated. "Compliance brings with it a great deal of risk and damage if mismanaged. Knowing that blockchain can't be tampered with can provide increased confidence in the data." 

Data management: improved product forecasting.  "Blockchain can improve the management of data in data provenance and accuracy through knowing more about digital assets and accompanying data." 

Data security: data breaches prevented. "Blockchain technology makes use of military-level cryptography."

Ownership: improved customer experience. "Blockchain technology can enable true digital ownership of both real-world goods and digital assets by creating improved intellectual property and personalized data profiles, without the need to check the history or current state of the item."

Payments: eliminated overpaying of invoices. "Blockchain technology can draw on the single shared data source to ensure payments are accurate and remove the need to manually audit and track down payments."

Process automation: resources reallocated. "Organizations can use blockchain to look for improvements in efficiency, cost savings and increased worker productivity and retention by shifting the focus of the workforce to one of jobs with higher engagement and satisfaction." 

Reconciliation: eliminated duplicate payments. "Blockchain technology can significantly cut down the overall costs in solving reconciliation while reducing errors and the accumulation of unreconciled items." 

Standardization: improved speed to market. In a blockchain network, multiple organizations "work together in a blockchain system, they must agree on common terms, business logic and business flow as they share access to the same data and apply the same smart contract-enabled business logic."

Track and trace: resource time saved. "Distributed ledger technology allows trading organizations to view each step of the supply-chain process. Each party can verify the current state and trail of the products without depending upon direct communication with others in the network."

Data sharing: enhanced value from data models. "With blockchain, however, trading partners can share real-time data, but also the history of that data and any modifications to it." 

Resiliency: decreased downtime. "Existing in a distributed form, blockchain creates a highly resilient network with multiple shared copies of the data, which mitigates the risk of an isolated attack or incident." 

Transparency: improved incident response rate. "Blockchain technologies' distributed ledger allows all designated parties to view the data in real time. With unlimited transparency, organizations can identify opportunities, improve decision-making and track and trace the outcome of those decisions."

Trust: mitigated business risk. "Trust is being challenged in the digital world, with organizations unable to verify basic essentials. Blockchain helps enable and even automate trust through cryptographically securing information and providing transparency to the state and trail of data." 

Authentication: prevention of attacks by bad actors. "A core function of blockchain technology is its public and private key cryptography, which can serve as a basis for authenticating one user across multiple networks, resulting in increased confidence in the overall network and participants." 
Identity management: improved retention rate. "It no longer makes sense to rely upon physical documents as the only means of establishing the identity of a user or object. Blockchain technology enables enhanced characteristics in how digital identity is both managed and used, while moving beyond the limitations of being operated by one institution."

Marketplace creation: new markets created. "Blockchain technology improves confidence in products and services in the marketplace, while also using a shared ledger, smart contracts and digital assets to facilitate real time peer-to-peer transactions." 

New and enhanced products and services: new product revenue. "New digital assets can exist beyond the umbrella of one organization, company or government."

New and expanded partnerships: new distribution channels. "Many of these partnerships can have automated components as well, through exploiting digital assets and smart contracts."

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
DiviStock is currently in the development stage, therefore performance evaluations are not available.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
I would advise theDiviStock staff to engage in AI technology to autonomously create and trade new financial instruments over blockchain.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
One of DiviStock’s features is the tokenization of assets and this trusted and secured process accumulates and stores a lot of data. AI models can be used to analyze, classify and make predictions from data. Due to the platform’s verification and validation process, all transactions provide quality datasets which allows AL to be effective with trading and transferring methods.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
 One technology that can be utilized to advance AI collaboratively with blockchain is to use a Decentralized & Collaborative AL on the Blockchain framework. Allowing advanced AL models and large dataset to be widely shared, updated and trained could increase the rate of AI adoption and effectiveness. This could lead to many applications developing virtual assistants or recommender systems for trading and transferring financial instruments.
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
